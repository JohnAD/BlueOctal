turn.php

Get the data to start a turn.

The <boardrow> entries are comma seperate values for each square on the board.:
  0 = Fog
  1-30 = Our pieces (5 at rank 1, etc. sequencially)
  50 = empty field
  100 = Enemy (not identified)
  101-4 = enemy troop ranks
  105 = enemy artillery
  106 = enemy bomb team
  "dead" pieces simply don't show up on the board
<boardrow> does not appear until round 2.
<lastrow> is identical, it simply shows the picture of the previous board. <lastrow> does not
appear until round 3.

The <lastmove> entries reflect the previous move.
For turns 0,1,2 there will be no lastmove items.
  Turn 0 = is the invite and accept stage.
  Turn 1 = is the build stage
  turn 2 = is the first move stage; but no historic moves are seen since the previous stage
    simply "built" things. There was no actual move made.
  Turn 3, etc.
For artillery, instead of east, west, etc. It uses roteast, rotwest, etc. for rotation moves
Artillery, can fire also. It uses fireeast, firewest, etc.
The enemy and enemyloc are only used for artillery fire. Otherwise, it is self-evident what happenned.

  boardstate
     nGameIndex
     nTurn
     nPiece (1-30 for challenger, 101-130 for defender)
     nRow
     nColumn
            this table contains the fully uncovered game board.
            only contains pieces in play.
            actual fog and/or clear field is determined programatically by turn.php
            this same table is also used by the lastrow function
            at the end of the game, only the last two turns are kept. All else is deleted.

  moves
     nGameIndex
     nTurn
     nPlayerIndex
     nPiece
     vcMove
     vcResult
     vcEnemyLoc
            this table contains the moves and their results.
            sendmove.php fills out the nGameIndex, nTurn, nPlayerIndex, nPiece, vcMove always
            if the player completes the turn, then sendmove.php also fills out vcResult, vcEnemyLoc

========================================================
sendmove.php

this function takes the players moves. See the 'moves' table as described above.
If this is the player to complete the turn, it also:
  loads the current board
  verifies that the moves are legitimate (later)
  resolves all the moves
  creates a new board
  adds to the vcResult and vcEnemyLoc field of 'moves' on behalf of each player.
  updates the 'games' table: incr round number and reset the 'played' fields.
  IF the game is in a Winning state, then that is also marked by flag. Zaps all but last two boards
     and last set of moves.
  TODO: add a past games viewer of some kind; so that the win state is marked.

The "get" parameters are a simple:
gid=N
userindex=N
p1=east
p2=north
p22=firewest
p23=roteast
...

On round1, the setup round, the format is actually:
p1=LOC3,2
p2=LOC0,7
...

This script takes a while to execute for the last person to send a move because it actually calculates the result of the turn during execution.
